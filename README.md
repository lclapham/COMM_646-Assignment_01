Assignment #1

Practice with jQuery Selectors and Commands
In this assignment you will practice working with jQuery selectors and commands. You will use a basic version of the Vecta Corp site in this assignment to select elements and then apply jQuery commands to those elements. To complete this assignment using jQuery only, complete the following steps:
General
1.	Find the jQuery library, download it, and reference it from within the Vecta Corp. web page. Do not use the CDN, use the downloadable library.
2.	Create a document ready function within an embedded script block in your web page. This is where you’ll write your code.
The Headings
3.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a CSS solid, black, 1px border to them.
4.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a color of #CC1C0D to them.
5.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a padding of 3px to the top and bottom and 20px to the left side.
6.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a border radius of 5px to the top right and bottom left corners only.
7.	Select the <h2> elements within the <section> and <aside> tags and apply a background color of #DFE3E6.
The Navigation Menu
8.	Programmatically add the class “navigation” to each of the 5 navigation menu items.
9.	Select the navigation classes and apply a CSS solid, #929CA4, 1px border to them.
10.	Select the navigation classes and apply a color of #CC1C0D to them.
11.	Select the navigation classes and apply a padding of 3px to the top and bottom and 20px to the left side.
12.	Select the navigation classes and apply a background color of #DFE3E6.
Main Content
13.	Programmatically remove the vprospect, vconvert, and vretain classes from the <p> tags in the main <section> tag.
14.	Programmatically add the text “Chevy Dealers Association” after the word “President” in the client testimonials section. Make sure to programmatically add a line break after the word “President” so that the new text you’re adding is placed directly underneath.
15.	Programmatically wrap the testimonial verbiage with a <q> tag.
Practice with jQuery Events
In this lab you will practice working with jQuery events. Code the following within a new web page to successfully complete this lab:
16.	Create a button on a web page. Use the .click() method to display an alert message to the user indicating that the button has been clicked when the button is actually clicked. 
17.	Create a button on a web page. Attach the click event using the .bind() method to display an alert message to the user indicating that the button has been clicked when the button is actually clicked. 
18.	Create a button on a web page. Attach the click event using the .on() method to display an alert message to the user indicating that the button has been clicked when the button is actually clicked. 
19.	Create two buttons on a web page. Attach the click event to both buttons using a single handler using the .on() method. Again, an alert message should be displayed to the user indicating that a button has been clicked when either of the buttons are actually clicked. 
20.	Create a div on a web page. Use jQuery to set the div element to 400px wide and 400px high. Attach the click, mouseenter, and mouseleave events using the .on() method. Display an alert message to the user indicating that the div was either clicked on, the mouse entered it, or the mouse left it. 
21.	Rewrite the code from number 5. This time add a span tag to the web page. Display three different messages within the span tag when the user enters the div, leaves the div, or clicks on the div.
22.	Create a link within the web page and set it’s href attribute to browse to modulemedia.com. When the user clicks the link, first, prevent it from redirecting to that web site. Second, programmatically style the link so that its color changes to red. Third, display the name of the node that triggered the event within an alert box.
23.	Create a div tag within the web page. As the user resizes the browser, display the width and height of the browser window within the div tag.
24.	Create a text field using the <input> tag. When the input has focus, set the background to a light gray color. When the input does not have focus, reset the background back to a white color.
25.	Add a form tag within a web page complete with 2 input fields: one that collects name and a second that collects an email. Add a submit button. When the user submits the form, if any one of the two fields is left empty, display an alert box to the user indicating that the fields are required. Give the field that the user left empty a red border. If both fields have values in them, set their borders to green.
